Hello!

This text file includes instructions for you to hopefully make grading a bit easier :)
One feature I would like for you to see are the cards that display the art objects.
To do this you must...

	1) Use the included images
		- I attached 4 images in the 'Instructions_pls_read' folder
		- You don't have to upload them all, but if you'd like to see how it looks with various 
		  images you can

	2) Download the images
		- Save them to the local machine that you're using to grade

	3) Create a gallery 
		- Set its start time to maybe 4-6 minutes after creation to give yourself enough time to 
		  upload the photos

	3) Upload the images 
		- Select the gallery in the Upcoming section
		- Click 'Upload Art'
		- Use the 'Pick Image' button to upload each of the images
		- The images cannot be viewed until the gallery is ongoing
		** Art can only be uploaded to a gallery that is upcoming **

	4) View the uploaded images
		- Once the gallery start time has passed, it'll move to the Ongoing section
		- Go to the ongoing section, select your gallery, and you should see the art
		  object cards with the images you uploaded!
